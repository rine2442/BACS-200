            <b>How to Motivate</b>
            Understand that everyone is different and you can not motivate every employee in the same way. A way to understand what your employees need you can have a one-on-one meeting with them to understand how they are motivated and what they are fueled by.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Incentives</b>
           Incentives are a great motivating factor in the world of business. Yes, money can be the biggest motivater but most people are motivated by much simpler things such as awards or family.
