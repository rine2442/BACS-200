            Here is some interesting info about Eleanor and her life.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>She helped her husband FDR when he was president and also when he was very sick with polio.</li>
            <li>She served as the First Lady of the United States from March 4, 1933, to April 12, 1945, during her husband President Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office, making her the longest-serving First Lady of the United States. </li>
            <li>She launched an experimental community at Arthurdale, West Virginia, for the families of unemployed miners, later widely regarded as a failure. She advocated for expanded roles for women in the workplace, the civil rights of African Americans and Asian Americans, and the rights of World War II refugees. </li>
            <li>The American Youth Congress was formed in 1935 to advocate for youth rights in U.S. politics, and it was responsible for introducing the American Youth Bill of Rights to the U.S. Congress. Roosevelt's relationship with the AYC eventually led to the formation of the National Youth Administration, a New Deal agency in the United States, founded in 1935, that focused on providing work and education for Americans between the ages of 16 and 25</li>
    </ul>
        <p>
           Eleanor was not only an amazing First lady of the United States but she was also a mother to five children. She loved to play games with them and made sure they had the best life possible. Also, even when FDR was sick Eleanor was always there for him and made sure he had everything he needed.
